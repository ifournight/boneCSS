      <h3>Responsive Grid: An Example</h3>
      <p>Resize the page to see the grid collapse</p>

  		<div class="row">

            <h3>Search, explore, bookmark, read</h3>
            <p>The usage of Documentation is pretty minimal. Just use a right swipe gesture to open the Tool Kit. There you can search, explore library, save bookmarks, and open documents to read them, just like using Xcode. But... With several minor tweaks.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-12 grid-demo-box">
          <h3>All-in-one Search</h3>
          <p>You can search all types of documentations (guides, references, APIs, sample codes, etc.) in one place. No switches or filters.</p>
        </div>

          <h3>Better search and result</h3>
          <p>Even you can't remember exactly a method name, you can get the result as long as the character you type contained in the method and the order is right. <br>
          Search results will be sorted to let you easily identify your aiming result. And the speed is fast!

          <h3>Use bookmark as notebook</h3>
          <p>Inspired by Evernote, bookmarks in <strong>Documentation</strong> is not the traditional bookmark function. It is more like a read-it-later notebooks. We developers can save documents and put to the bookmark folder we name. What to bookmark and which folder to save is up to you. Bookmarks in <strong>Documentation</strong> is your Dev inventory.</p>
